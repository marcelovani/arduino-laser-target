## Laser tag gun
We are using an existing toy that already shoots using Infra-red.

### Infrared
[This class](https://github.com/marcelovani/arduino-laser-target/blob/master/Infra.cpp) is responsible to detect which gun shot the target.

### Laser
Laser is used only for visuals, ideally this game should be played in a wide space like a garage, with a smoke machine to make the laser beams visible.
This circuit is added to the toy to make it shoot only once, for a short period of time.
