## Building the project
This file is divided into multiple .cpp classes.
Typically we would use the usual C++ includes, but in order to run the code on online
emulators (links below), we use a script to combine all files into one file i.e. build/main.ino.

1. Use `sh ./build.sh` to concatenate all files into one on `./build` folder.
1. Copy the content of main.io inside the emulator.
